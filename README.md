# The Commander Cube

The commander cube is a collection of five mono-colored Commander (EDH) decks
with the idea that you should be able to shuffle all the non-basics from the
different decks together to form a cohesive cube for drafting.

## Breakdown

* Each commander deck must contain exactly 28 basic lands. This leaves 72 cards
  for each respective color, including artifacts and non-basic lands, making for
  a cube of 360 cards.
* Naturally, there should be a power level balance between the Commander lists
  and similarly in the cube's dominant archetypes - which need not be strictly
  along color lines.
* Decks should stick close to a rarity breakdown mirroring that of a standard
  booster pack. This means roughly:
   * 5 rares/mythic rares
   * 15 uncommons
   * 50 commons
   * 2 flex slots
  Note that this is only a guideline and a secondary concern to balanced power.

## Restrictions

### There can still only be one!

For now, we're going to allow for duplicates across Commander lists. However,
while drafting The Commander Cube you may only __play__ with one copy of a given
non-basic in your final deck. You can still hate draft that second `Sol Ring` if
you like, but ultimately you may not play with more than one.
