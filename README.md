# The Commander Cube

The commander cube is a collection of five three color Commander (EDH) decks
with the idea that you should be able to shuffle all the non-basics from the
different decks together (plus some extra cards for added variance and curve
smoothing) to form a cohesive cube for drafting.

## Breakdown

- We'll take the [2013 Commander Precons][1] as a starting point for our five
  decks and try to roughly maintain their power levels.
- To help fill out curves for drafting and to support the different archetypes
  we'll supplement the commander decks with enough to fill out a 720 card cube.
- The commander decks should keep a reasonably casual focus but will probably
  cut commander specific cards (e.g. Command Tower).

## Restrictions and Goals

- __Modern+__. I would like the Commander lists to be a reasonable entry point
  for players new to the Commander format and Magic in general. So, for the sake
  of consistency and to avoid cards with crazy wordings, lets limit the card
  pool to only physical cards printed with the new card frame.  We're not
  strictly sticking to modern legal cards though, anything with a new frame
  is acceptable.
- __No Foils__. This is mostly in reference to the above restriction. There are
  some cards which have only been printed with a new frame in a premium foil
  version. We're not going to include those in our pool.

### There can still only be one!

For now, we're going to allow for duplicates across Commander lists. However,
while drafting The Commander Cube you may only __play__ with one copy of a given
non-basic in your final deck. You can still hate draft that second `Sol Ring` if
you like, but ultimately you may not play with more than one.
