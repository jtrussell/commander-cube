# The Commander Cube

The commander cube is a collection of five three color Commander (EDH) decks
with the idea that you should be able to shuffle all the non-basics from the
different decks together to form a cohesive cube for drafting.

For a starting point We'll use the
[2013 Commander precons](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/269c).

## Breakdown

* Each commander deck must contain exactly 28 basic lands. This leaves 72 cards
  for each respective color, including artifacts and non-basic lands, making for
  a contribution of 360 cards toward the cube.
* Naturally, there should be a power level balance between the Commander lists
  and similarly in the cube's dominant archetypes - which need not be strictly
  along color lines.
* [?] Decks should stick close to a rarity breakdown mirroring that of a standard
  booster pack. Note that this is only a guideline and a secondary concern to
  balanced power. Here's what we have as a starting point:
   * 5 rares/mythic rares
   * 15 uncommons
   * 50 commons
   * 2 flex slots
* We'll add another 180-360(?) cards to the cube in addition to the decks to help
  smooth out curves, support draft archetypes, and add some variance.

## Restrictions

* __Modern+__. I would like the Commander lists to be a reasonable entry point
  for players new to the Commander format and Magic in general. So, for the sake
  of consistency and to avoid cards with crazy wordings, lets limit the card
  pool to only physical cards printed with the new card frame.  We're not
  strictly sticking to modern legal cards though, anything with a new frame
  is acceptable.
* __No Foils__. This is mostly in reference to the above restriction. There are
  some cards which have only been printed with a new frame in a premium foil
  version. We're not going to include those in our pool.

### There can still only be one!

For now, we're going to allow for duplicates across Commander lists. However,
while drafting The Commander Cube you may only __play__ with one copy of a given
non-basic in your final deck. You can still hate draft that second `Sol Ring` if
you like, but ultimately you may not play with more than one.
